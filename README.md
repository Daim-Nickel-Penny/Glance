# Project Title

**Description**: This is a browser extension designed primarily for the Chrome browser that converts the text into bionic reading format.

## What is Bionic Reading?

**Bionic Reading** is a new method facilitating the reading process by guiding the eyes through text with artificial fixation points. As a result, the reader is only focusing on the highlighted initial letters and lets the brain center complete the word.  
In a digital world dominated by shallow forms of reading, Bionic Reading aims to encourage a more in-depth reading and understanding of written content.
